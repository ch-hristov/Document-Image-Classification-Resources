# Document classification resources ðŸ“ƒ

The goal of this repository is to create a library of useful resources that may help researchers in solving the problem of document classification. This document is repeatedly updated.

## State of the art:
The best performing model can be found here: 
https://paperswithcode.com/task/document-classification

## Datasets
The majority of literature uses the Tobacco-3482 and the RVL-CDIP datasets. Downloading these datasets is possible in the links below:

1. Tobacco 3482 - https://www.kaggle.com/patrickaudriaz/tobacco3482jpg
2. RVL-CDIP - http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aharley/rvl-cdip/ 


## Models

### Image models

- EfficientNet - a model that is fit for the document classification problem due to availability of document in mostly high resolution 
 Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946
 

### Text models
OCR text for RVL-CDIP and Tobacco 3482 can be downloaded from.

https://github.com/Quicksign/ocrized-text-dataset/releases

Where RVL-CDIP is QS-OCR-Large.tar.gz and Tobacco 3482 is QS-OCR-small.tar.gz

#### Preprocessing
There are several steps that you may take to preprocess the text after extraction

## Multi modal fusion research

- Survey of multimodal fusion methods* - This survey does an excellent job at explaining the various pros/cons of multimodal fusion approaches https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8715409.
